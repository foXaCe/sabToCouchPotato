Currently testing NZBGet V11
NZBGet V11+ calls multiple scripts directly. This current configuration is no-longer used and the entire nzbget-postprocessing-files folder will be deleted once NZBGet V11 is stable.

Please see http://nzbget.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=740 for details of the new scripts concept.
